Excess nitrogen can come from places like animal waste or fertilizer. This excess is often seen near large residential areas, due to pets and their waste, or near ranches and the animal waste found there. When there is too much nitrogen, the water will experience algal blooms. This doesn't sound that bad because algae is a producer. The problem is when the algae dies, their decomposition removes all the oxygen from the water and kills the aquatic life."

First, pick up after your dog or pet if it gets rid of solid waste. Second, make sure you don't over fertilize your lawn. Third, make sure that any toxic chemicals are disposed of correctly and not just dumped onto the ground or in the gutter. Lastly, don't litter. Try to reduce the amount of trash on the ground. Help with local clean up efforts."
